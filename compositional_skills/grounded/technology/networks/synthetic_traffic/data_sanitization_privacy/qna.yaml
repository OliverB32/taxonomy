  structural and statistical properties for realistic synthetic datasets.

  - context: |
      | Original IP     | Role   |
      |-----------------|--------|
      | 192.168.1.25    | Client |
      | 192.168.1.1     | GW     |
    question: |
      Replace IPs preserving subnet relationships (internal->10.0.0.0/24).
    answer: |
      10.0.0.25 (Client), 10.0.0.1 (GW)
  - context: |
      | Original MAC            |
      |-------------------------|
      | 00:11:22:33:44:55       |
    question: |
      Provide a deterministic anonymized MAC preserving vendor prefix.
    answer: |
      Replace OUI but keep local uniqueness, e.g. "02:11:22:33:44:55" (locally administered bit set).
  - context: |
      Hostnames: "alice-workstation.company.internal"
    question: |
      How to sanitize hostnames while keeping role semantics?
    answer: |
      Map to pseudonyms preserving role: "host-client-01.local" and store mapping in a separate mapping file for reproducibility.
  - context: |
      | Original public IP | Observed |
      |--------------------|----------|
      | 198.51.100.45      | Outbound |
    question: |
      When anonymizing public IPs in aggregated datasets, what's a safe approach?
    answer: |
      Hash the IP into a stable token (e.g., HMAC with key) and optionally map to an IP in reserved/test space for realism.
  - context: |
      Dataset contains small payloads with usernames in cleartext ("bob", "admin").
    question: |
      How to sanitize application-layer identifiers while preserving frequency?
    answer: |
      Replace with tokens preserving cardinality and frequency (e.g., user_01, user_02) using deterministic mapping.
