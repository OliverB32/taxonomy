task_description: |
  Model synthetic traffic flows and produce replay schedules (packet sequences with timing)
  and high-level instructions for deterministic or stochastic replay.

  - context: |
      | Flow ID | src_ip    | dst_ip    | Proto | Packets | Avg interval (ms) |
      |---------|-----------|-----------|-------|---------|-------------------|
      | F1      | 10.0.0.2  | 10.0.0.1  | TCP   | 5       | 12                |
    question: |
      Produce a packet send schedule (timestamps relative to start) for F1 with deterministic spacing.
    answer: |
      [0.000, 0.012, 0.024, 0.036, 0.048] seconds — send 5 TCP packets from 10.0.0.2 to 10.0.0.1.
  - context: |
      Flow: HTTP-like exchange: client 10.1.1.2 -> server 10.1.1.10; request (1 pkt), server replies (3 pkts).
    question: |
      Describe a replay order and approximate inter-packet timings for a single request/response.
    answer: |
      Client sends request at t=0, server replies with first response packet at t=0.020, additional two follow at t=0.030 and t=0.042.
  - context: |
      | Flow | pkts | mean_ms | jitter_ms |
      |------|------|---------|-----------|
      | A    | 10   | 50      | 10        |
    question: |
      Generate 5 sample inter-arrival intervals in seconds using mean and jitter (approx).
    answer: |
      [0.050, 0.063, 0.041, 0.055, 0.047] seconds
  - context: |
      Replay mode: deterministic ordered replay of a saved trace with 100 packets.
    question: |
      What key constraints must the replay tool enforce to preserve semantics?
    answer: |
      Preserve original timestamps or apply a field scale factor, maintain packet order per flow, and keep inter-packet spacing within jitter tolerance.
  - context: |
      Flow set: 2 flows:
      Flow1: 100 pkts, mean 10ms
      Flow2: 50 pkts, mean 200ms
    question: |
      Propose a simple mixing schedule so flows run concurrently but keep relative rates.
    answer: |
      Interleave events using a priority queue by next-timestamp: emit Flow1 packets ~ every 10ms and Flow2 every 200ms; this keeps relative densities while allowing concurrency.
