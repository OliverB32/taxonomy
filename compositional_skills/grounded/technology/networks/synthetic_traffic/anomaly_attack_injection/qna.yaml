task_description: |
  Inject controlled, benign anomaly patterns (bursts, scans, malformed headers, high-error rates)
  to increase dataset diversity. All examples are synthetic-only and non-executable.

      | E1    | 50 SYN packets to sequential ports   |
    question: |
      What benign anomaly pattern does E1 simulate and how to label it?
    answer: |
      Simulates a TCP port scan (SYN scan). Label as "synthetic_port_scan:syn_probe".

      | E2    | Burst: 200 packets in 100ms        |
    question: |
      How to parameterize this burst for generation?
    answer: |
      Set burst window=0.100s, packet_count=200, per-packet interval ≈0.0005s (or use Poisson with high lambda).

      | E3    | Sequence of packets with increasing TTLs and a final ICMP unreachable |
    question: |
      What benign scenario could this emulate?
    answer: |
      Emulates traceroute-like behavior or path discovery (incrementing TTLs causing ICMP replies).

      | E4    | Packets with small checksum errors |
    question: |
      How should these be represented in JSON traces for analysis?
    answer: |
      Add metadata {"checksum_valid": false, "error_type": "checksum"}; do not include exploit payloads.

      | E5    | Slowloris-like pattern: many partial HTTP requests held open |
    question: |
      How to simulate this at packet level without harmful content?
    answer: |
      Emit many small TCP segments with incomplete application-layer data and long inter-segment delays; label as "synthetic_slow_connect".
