  - context: |
      | Flow | count | mean_ms | std_ms |
      |------|-------|---------|--------|
      | X    | 4     | 10      | 2      |
    question: |
      Produce a plausible sequence of timestamps (seconds) starting at 0 using mean and std dev.
    answer: |
      [0.000, 0.011, 0.021, 0.032]
  - context: |
      Timing model: Poisson arrivals with lambda=50 per second (mean inter-arrival 20ms). Generate five intervals.
    question: |
      Provide five sample inter-arrival times in seconds consistent with Poisson.
    answer: |
      [0.018, 0.022, 0.030, 0.010, 0.024]
  - context: |
      Flow with fixed 100ms spacing but ±10ms uniform jitter, 3 packets.
    question: |
      Give three timestamps (seconds) with jitter applied.
    answer: |
      [0.000, 0.090, 0.205]
  - context: |
      Observed timestamps (s): [0.0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.2, 0.25]
    question: |
      Compute mean inter-arrival time and identify outliers (>2x mean).
    answer: |
      Inter-arrivals: [0.05,0.02,0.13,0.05]; mean = 0.0625s; outlier: 0.13s (>2*mean).
  - context: |
      Burst scenario: 10 packets in ~50ms, then idle 500ms. Describe a timing model for bursts.
    question: |
      How to model burst with two-state (ON/OFF) process?
    answer: |
      Use an ON state with high-rate arrivals (e.g., inter-arrival mean 5ms) for burst duration; OFF state long idle with mean 500ms; switch between states using geometric/exponential durations.
