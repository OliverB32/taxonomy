  - context: |
      | Node   | IP         | Role    |
      |--------|------------|---------|
      | Rtr1   | 10.0.0.1   | Gateway |
      | HostA  | 10.0.0.2   | Client  |
      | HostB  | 10.0.0.3   | Server  |
    question: |
      Which node is the gateway for HostA and HostB?
    answer: |
      Rtr1 (10.0.0.1) is the gateway for both hosts.
  - context: |
      Topology: Host in subnet 192.168.10.0/24 sends to 192.168.20.5/24; gateway 192.168.10.1 routes to 192.168.20.1
    question: |
      Describe the path packets take from the host to the destination.
    answer: |
      Host -> local gateway 192.168.10.1 -> inter-subnet route -> gateway 192.168.20.1 -> destination.
  - context: |
      VLANs:
      HostA VLAN 10 (10.0.10.2), HostB VLAN 20 (10.0.20.2), trunk to router.
    question: |
      How to annotate packets to retain VLAN context in generated traffic?
    answer: |
      Include VLAN tag metadata per frame: {"vlan":10,"src":"10.0.10.2"} so replay preserves segmentation.
  - context: |
      NAT box maps internal 172.16.0.2 to public 198.51.100.3 for outbound traffic.
    question: |
      When generating return traffic, which IP should appear as destination externally and internally?
    answer: |
      Externally: destination = 198.51.100.3; internally the NAT should map it to 172.16.0.2 in the captured internal trace.
  - context: |
      Multi-hop: Host -> Switch -> RouterA -> RouterB -> Server.
    question: |
      For per-hop latency modeling, where is latency applied and how recorded?
    answer: |
      Apply per-hop delays at each router/switch stage; record cumulative timestamp at egress of each hop to allow realistic RTT calculations.
