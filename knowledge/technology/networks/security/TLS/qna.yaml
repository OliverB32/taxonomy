  - context: |
      Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a computer network. It provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for applications such as HTTPS, email, instant messaging, and VoIP. TLS is composed of two layers: the TLS record protocol and the TLS handshake protocol.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the primary purpose of TLS?
        answer: |
          TLS provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for data exchanged between applications over a network, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.
      - question: |
          Which applications commonly use TLS?
        answer: |
          TLS is commonly used to secure HTTPS web traffic, email protocols (like SMTP/IMAPS), instant messaging, and voice-over-IP (VoIP) applications.
      - question: |
          What are the two main protocol layers that make up TLS?
        answer: |
          TLS is composed of the TLS record protocol, which handles fragmentation and encryption of application data, and the TLS handshake protocol, which negotiates keys and cipher suites.
  - context: |
      TLS uses a handshake to negotiate security parameters and establish shared session keys. The handshake typically involves the client presenting supported cipher suites, the server choosing parameters and presenting a certificate, and key exchange (for example Diffie–Hellman or RSA) to derive symmetric session keys. TLS 1.3 simplified and shortened the handshake compared to earlier versions.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the purpose of the TLS handshake?
        answer: |
          The TLS handshake negotiates cipher suites and authentication, and establishes shared session keys used to encrypt subsequent application data.
      - question: |
          How does key exchange occur in TLS?
        answer: |
          Key exchange can use RSA encryption of a premaster secret (older versions) or Diffie–Hellman (including elliptic-curve variants) to derive session keys; TLS 1.3 requires key exchange algorithms that provide forward secrecy.
      - question: |
          How did TLS 1.3 change the handshake compared to earlier versions?
        answer: |
          TLS 1.3 reduces round trips, removes legacy insecure options, and mandates forward-secret key exchanges, making the handshake faster and more secure.
  - context: |
      Digital certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) are central to TLS authentication. A server typically presents an X.509 certificate that includes its identity and a public key; clients verify the certificate chain up to a trusted CA. Certificate validation involves checking signatures, expiration, and that the certificate is issued for the expected domain name.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What role do certificates and certificate authorities play in TLS?
        answer: |
          Certificates assert the identity of a server (or client) and contain public keys; certificate authorities sign certificates to vouch for their authenticity, allowing clients to validate the server's identity.
      - question: |
          What checks does a client perform when validating a TLS certificate?
        answer: |
          A client checks the certificate's signature chain to a trusted CA, verifies expiration dates, and ensures the certificate is valid for the requested domain name.
      - question: |
          What certificate format is commonly used with TLS?
        answer: |
          TLS commonly uses X.509 certificates to convey identity and public-key information.
  - context: |
      TLS supports multiple cryptographic algorithms organized into cipher suites: key-exchange (or key-agreement) algorithms, symmetric encryption ciphers, and hash-based message authentication (or AEAD) algorithms for integrity. Over time weak algorithms (e.g., RC4, MD5-based MACs) and insecure modes have been deprecated in favor of modern AEAD ciphers and elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What components make up a TLS cipher suite?
        answer: |
          A TLS cipher suite specifies the key-exchange algorithm, the symmetric encryption cipher (or AEAD), and the message-authentication or hash algorithm used for integrity.
      - question: |
          Why have some TLS algorithms been deprecated?
        answer: |
          Algorithms like RC4 or weak hash functions have been deprecated because of discovered vulnerabilities and weaknesses; modern TLS favors AEAD ciphers and forward-secret key exchanges.
      - question: |
          What is forward secrecy and why is it important in TLS?
        answer: |
          Forward secrecy ensures that compromise of long-term keys (like a server private key) does not allow decryption of past sessions, typically achieved via ephemeral Diffie–Hellman key exchanges.
  - context: |
      TLS has evolved from SSL and is standardized by the IETF. Major versions include TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 and the current TLS 1.3. The protocol faces implementation and configuration issues that have led to notable vulnerabilities (for example, downgrade attacks, Heartbleed, POODLE-related issues in legacy SSL), and operators must follow best practices such as disabling old protocol versions and using strong cipher suites.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the current major version of TLS and when was it standardized?
        answer: |
          The current major version is TLS 1.3, which was standardized in August 2018.
      - question: |
          Name some historical security issues related to TLS/SSL.
        answer: |
          Historical issues include downgrade attacks, the Heartbleed vulnerability (OpenSSL), POODLE (affecting SSLv3), and weaknesses in older ciphers and protocol versions.
      - question: |
          What are common operational best practices for securing TLS deployments?
        answer: |
          Best practices include disabling obsolete protocol versions (SSL, TLS 1.0/1.1), preferring TLS 1.3 or TLS 1.2 with strong cipher suites, enabling forward secrecy, and properly managing certificates and revocation.
document_outline: |
  The Wikipedia article on Transport Layer Security (TLS) describes TLS as a cryptographic protocol that secures data in transit by providing confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. The article explains TLS components such as the record and handshake protocols, how the handshake negotiates cipher suites and performs key exchange, and the role of X.509 certificates and certificate authorities in authentication. It outlines cipher suite composition, the importance of forward secrecy, the evolution from SSL to TLS (with TLS 1.3 as the most recent major version), and operational security considerations and historic vulnerabilities.
