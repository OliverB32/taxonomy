  - context: |
      Malware is malicious software designed to infiltrate, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Common goals include data theft, service disruption, espionage, or creating a foothold for further attacks. Malware may be delivered through email attachments, malicious websites, removable media, or software supply-chain compromises.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is malware?
        answer: |
          Malware (malicious software) is software designed to infiltrate, damage, or otherwise compromise computers, networks, or data for malicious purposes.
      - question: |
          What are common goals of malware?
        answer: |
          Common goals include data exfiltration, denial of service, financial theft, surveillance/espionage, and establishing persistent access for later attacks.
      - question: |
          How is malware commonly delivered to targets?
        answer: |
          Malware is commonly delivered via phishing emails and attachments, malicious websites or drive-by downloads, infected removable media, software supply-chain compromises, and exploitation of network services or vulnerabilities.
  - context: |
      Malware comes in many forms. Notable categories include viruses (which attach to host files), worms (self-replicating across networks), trojans (malicious payloads disguised as legitimate software), ransomware (encrypts data for extortion), spyware (collects information covertly), adware, rootkits (hide presence and provide privileged access), and botnets (networks of compromised hosts).
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is the difference between a virus and a worm?
        answer: |
          A virus attaches to files or programs and requires user action to propagate, while a worm is self-replicating and spreads across networks without needing to attach to host files.
      - question: |
          What is ransomware?
        answer: |
          Ransomware is malware that encrypts a victim's files or systems and demands payment (a ransom) in exchange for the decryption key or to prevent data release.
      - question: |
          What is a rootkit and why is it dangerous?
        answer: |
          A rootkit is designed to hide the presence of malicious software and often grants attackers persistent, privileged access to a system, making detection and removal difficult.
  - context: |
      Advanced malware techniques include polymorphism and metamorphism (to evade signature detection), use of zero-day exploits, fileless malware that runs in memory, and living-off-the-land tactics that abuse legitimate system tools. Supply-chain attacks compromise trusted software updates or packages to distribute malware widely.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What is polymorphic malware?
        answer: |
          Polymorphic malware changes its code appearance (e.g., via encryption or obfuscation) each time it propagates to evade signature-based detection while preserving its behavior.
      - question: |
          What is a supply-chain attack in the context of malware?
        answer: |
          A supply-chain attack compromises a trusted software vendor, update mechanism, or library so that malware is distributed through legitimate channels to many downstream users.
      - question: |
          What does "fileless malware" mean?
        answer: |
          Fileless malware operates primarily in system memory or uses legitimate system tools (like PowerShell) rather than writing persistent files to disk, making detection by traditional file-scanning tools harder.
  - context: |
      Detection techniques include signature-based scanning, heuristic and behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, sandboxing and dynamic analysis, and telemetry/endpoint detection and response (EDR). Combining multiple detection methods improves chances of identifying both known and novel threats.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How does signature-based detection work?
        answer: |
          Signature-based detection matches file or binary patterns against a database of known malware signatures; it is effective for known threats but can be evaded by new or obfuscated malware.
      - question: |
          What is behavioral detection in malware analysis?
        answer: |
          Behavioral detection monitors the runtime actions of programs (for example, attempts to modify many files, create network connections, or escalate privileges) to identify malicious activity even if the exact binary is unknown.
      - question: |
          Why are sandboxes used in malware detection?
        answer: |
          Sandboxes execute suspicious files in an isolated, instrumented environment to observe behavior and extract indicators of compromise without risking production systems.
  - context: |
      Mitigation and response to malware include patching vulnerable systems, using up-to-date endpoint protection and EDR tools, network segmentation, least-privilege access controls, regular backups (air-gapped when possible), incident response planning, threat intelligence sharing, and user education to reduce successful phishing and social-engineering vectors.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What role do patches and updates play in preventing malware infections?
        answer: |
          Patches fix security vulnerabilities that malware exploits; timely patching reduces the attack surface and prevents many automated or opportunistic infections.
      - question: |
          How do backups help in ransomware incidents?
        answer: |
          Secure, tested backups allow restoration of data without paying a ransom, greatly reducing the impact of ransomware attacks.
      - question: |
          Why is user education important in malware defense?
        answer: |
          Many malware infections begin with phishing or social engineering; educating users to recognise suspicious emails, links, and attachments reduces the likelihood of successful compromise.
document_outline: |
  The Wikipedia article on malware defines malicious software and outlines its purpose, delivery mechanisms, and impact. It classifies common malware types such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, and botnets, and discusses advanced techniques like polymorphism, fileless attacks, zero-day exploitation, and supply-chain compromise. The article describes detection methods (signatures, heuristics, behavioral analysis, sandboxing, EDR) and outlines mitigation strategies including patching, endpoint protection, backups, network segmentation, incident response, and user awareness.
